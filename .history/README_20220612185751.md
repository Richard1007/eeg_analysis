# eeg_analysis

#### This is a brief summary of the work done in this github repository. For more detailed infomation, please refer to the jupyter notebook file "eeg.ipynb". <br/><br/>  As I do not have neuroscience background, all the work done here could be wrong and misleading. Feel free to leave me a message for any correction. 

## 1. Collect 10 eeg raw data
The data I use is an edf file, which can be found in the 'data' folder. 

## 2. Using eeg lab/field trip library in Matlab calculate alpha, Beta, and gamma of the signals 


## 3. Using python language write a code and calculate the alpha and gamma â€¦ with same data
After doing some research, I believe the easiest way to calculate band powers is to use the "yasa" library from UC Berkeley. The exact steps can be found in the "eeg.ipynb" file.

## 4. Compare results of your code with matlab results 


## 5. Write a python code to find anomalies in eeg based on alpha beta gamma delta you calculate in part 3

# eeg_analysis

## 1. Collect 10 eeg raw data


## 2. Using eeg lab/field trip library in Matlab calculate alpha, Beta, and gamma of the signals 


## 3. Using python language write a code and calculate the alpha and gamma â€¦ with same data


## 4. Compare results of your code with matlab results 


## 5. Write a python code to find anomalies in eeg based on alpha beta gamma delta you calculate in part 3


### You should Jupyter notebook file explaining each part what they have done briefly, plus other things they think is necessary
